            <p>Todd Manning  is a fictional character from the American daytime
               drama One Life to Live. Created by writer Michael Malone, the r
               ole was originated in 1992 by actor Roger Howarth, recast with
               Trevor St. John in 2003, and given back to Howarth in 2011. Todd
                became part of a groundbreaking storyline in which Marty Saybr
                ooke was gang raped. Todd's popularity with the audience and
                critics, even after the rape, persuaded the writers to retain
                the character. While keeping aspects of his personality dark
                and violent, they had Todd exhibit a conscience and compassion.
                They took steps to redeem him, borrowing from nineteenth-century
                melodrama, Gothic traditions, and literature such as Frankenstein,
                despite Howarth's objections to a redemption storyline for a rapist.
                Todd has been the subject of many scholarly feminist studies.
                He has remained a popular and controversial figure since his c
                reation, and is considered one of soap opera's breakout chara
                cters. The main players in the rape storyline—Howarth, Susan
                Haskell (Marty), and Hillary B. Smith (Todd's lawyer Nora Han
                en)—won Emmys in 1994, as did Malone and his writing team. (F
